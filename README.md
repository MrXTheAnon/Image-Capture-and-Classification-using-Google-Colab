# Image-Capture-and-Classification-using-Google-Colab
This repository contains a Python script that uses Google Colab to capture an image from a webcam, saves it, and classifies it using a pre-trained Keras model. The script includes functions for capturing photos, loading a Keras model, preprocessing images, and displaying classification results along with the confidence score.
